# 📚 Machine Learning Papers Collection

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Papers Collection** repository! This space is dedicated to gathering and organizing important research papers in the field of Machine Learning. The collection features a mix of classical, foundational, and cutting-edge research that I find particularly valuable for continuous learning and reference.

## 🗂️ Structure

The papers are organized into various categories, with each category representing a subfield of Machine Learning or a specific topic of interest. Each paper is stored with its corresponding BibTeX entry (where applicable) and a brief summary.

### Categories
- **Supervised Learning**
- **Unsupervised Learning**
- **Reinforcement Learning**
- **Natural Language Processing**
- **Computer Vision**
- **Optimization and Theoretical Foundations**
- **Deep Learning**
- **Generative Models**
- **Probabilistic Models**
- **Ethics and Fairness in AI**
- **Miscellaneous**

Feel free to browse through each folder for PDFs, summaries, and additional resources.
